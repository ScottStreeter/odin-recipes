        <h1>Lasagne</h1>
            <img src="../img/making lasagne" alt="An image of Lasasgne being made">
            <p>Lasagne is a classic Italian al forno dish that generally consists of alternating layers of pasta sheets and various fillings, including - though not exclusively - ragù, besciamella and cheese, such as mozzarella, ricotta or Parmesan. Typically, this assembled dish is then baked in an oven until piping hot and all the cheese has melted. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Sauce</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
                    <li>3 (15 ounce) cans tomato puree</li>
                    <li>4 ¼ cups water, or to taste</li>
                    <li>6 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                    <li>6 leaves fresh basil</li>               
                </ul>   
            <H3>Filling</H3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
                    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>           
                </ul>    
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion; saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in tomato puree and water; cook for 10 minutes. Stir in sugar and basil. Reduce heat to low; simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>While the sauce is cooking, bring a very large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.</li>    
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add ground beef to cooked pasta. Mix in enough tomato sauce to lightly coat the pasta.</li>
                <li>Mix ricotta cheese and water in a bowl until it reaches a spreadable consistency.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Spread a ladleful of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add 1/2 of the pasta, all of the ricotta cheese, peas, and 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese. Layer the sliced eggs on every section of the pasta; cover with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Pour remaining pasta, Parmesan cheese, sauce, and mozzarella on top. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly, 40 to 50 minutes. Let stand for about 10 minutes before cutting, so slices don't fall apart.</li>
            </ol>
